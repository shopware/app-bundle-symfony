# App Bundle

App Bundle integrates the PHP App SDK for Symfony.

## Installation

```bash
composer require shopware/app-bundle
```

## Quick Start

### 1. Create a new Symfony Project (skip if existing)

```bash
composer create-project symfony/skeleton:"6.2.*" my-app
```

### 2. Install the App Bundle in your Symfony Project

```bash
composer require shopware/app-bundle
```

It's also recommended to install the monolog bundle to have logging:

```bash
composer require logger
```

### 3. Create a new App manifest

Here is an example app manifest

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<manifest xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
          xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shopware/platform/trunk/src/Core/Framework/App/Manifest/Schema/manifest-2.0.xsd">
    <meta>
        <name>TestApp</name>
        <label>TestApp</label>
        <label lang="de-DE">TestApp</label>
        <description/>
        <description lang="de-DE"/>
        <author>Your Company</author>
        <copyright>(c) by Your Company</copyright>
        <version>1.0.0</version>
        <icon>Resources/config/plugin.png</icon>
        <license>MIT</license>
    </meta>
    <setup>
        <registrationUrl>http://localhost:8000/app/lifecycle/register</registrationUrl>
        <secret>TestSecret</secret>
    </setup>
    <webhooks>
        <webhook name="appActivated" url="http://localhost:8000/app/lifecycle/activate" event="app.activated"/>
        <webhook name="appDeactivated" url="http://localhost:8000/app/lifecycle/deactivate" event="app.deactivated"/>
        <webhook name="appDeleted" url="http://localhost:8000/app/lifecycle/delete" event="app.deleted"/>
    </webhooks>
</manifest>
```

change the app name and the app secret to your needs
and also adjust the environment variables inside your `.env` file to match them.

By default, the following routes are registered:

- `/app/lifecycle/register` - Register the app
- `/app/lifecycle/activate` - Activate the app
- `/app/lifecycle/deactivate` - Deactivate the app
- `/app/lifecycle/delete` - Delete the app

You can change the prefix by editing the `config/routes/shopware_app.yaml` file.

The registration also dispatches events to react to the different lifecycle events. See APP SDK docs for it

### 4. Connecting Doctrine to a Database

The App Bundle brings by default a basic Shop entity to store the shop information.
You can extend this entity to store more information about your app if needed.

Doctrine is by default configured to use PostgreSQL. If you want to use MySQL, you need to change the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable in your `.env` file.
For development, you can use also sqlite by setting the `DATABASE_URL` to `sqlite:///%kernel.project_dir%/var/app.db`.

After choosing your database engine, make sure you create your first migration using `./bin/console make:migration`.
(Requires Migration Bundle `composer req migrations`)

and apply it with the command: `bin/console doctrine:migrations:migrate`.

### 5. Implement first ActionButtons, Webhooks, Payment

[Checkout the Official app documentation to learn more about the different integration points with this SDK](https://developer.shopware.com/docs/guides/plugins/apps).

You can also check out the [APP SDK](https://github.com/shopware/app-php-sdk) documentation.

### Optional: Webhook as Symfony Events

The app bundle registers also a generic webhook controller which dispatches the webhook as Symfony event. 
To use that, register your Shopware webhooks to the generic webhook which is by default `/app/webhook`
```xml
<webhook name="productWritten" url="http://localhost:8000/app/webhook" event="product.written"/>
```

With that, you can write a Symfony EventListener/Subscriber to listen to the event and react to it.

```php
#[AsEventListener(event: 'webhook.product.written')]
class ProductUpdatedListener
{
    public function __invoke(WebhookAction $action): void
    {
        // handle the webhook
    }
}
```
